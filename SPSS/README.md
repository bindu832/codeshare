IBM's SPSS Statistics (originally Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a software package used for statistical analysis. It features a default suite of statistical capabilities, and features many optional proprietary add-ons for a myriad of niches across business, science, social science, health, and beyond. Something of a juggernaut, it is one of the most powerful, biggest-business and longest-running statistical packages on the market, as well as one of the most expensive. It's a common application for statistical analysis in many older IR offices.

## Tips & Tricks
As submitted by members.
* Remember that when you run a crosstab, you can add many layers, then edit the output table, enabling *pivoting trays*, to move around rows, columns, and generally completely reconfigure the layout/structure of the output. Very useful to reorganize things into the format you need them to be - particularly when your data is complex.
  * You can [use Excel to "fill down" values](/Excel%20%26%20Visual%20Basic#tips-and-tricks) with these tables, if it helps.
