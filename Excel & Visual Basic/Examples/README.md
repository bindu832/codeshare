## File Descriptions
* [Auto-Report Example.xlsm](/Excel%20%26%20Visual%20Basic/Examples/Auto-Report%20Example.xlsm)

	This file demonstrates how to use Visual Basic (VBA) in Excel to loop a reporting template through a list of program keys. Each loop changes up a report sheet (or sheets) to show data for a different program. Then Excel is instructed to export that sheet (or sheets), either to a PDF or as a static Excel file. The result is that you can assemble your data into a reporting "machine", hit a button, and all your reports spit out sequentially in the span of a few seconds or minutes.<br>

* [Conditional Format Table.xlsx](/Excel%20%26%20Visual%20Basic/Examples/Conditional%20Format%20Table.xlsx)

	This file demonstrates how to use conditional formatting to format a pivot table just the way you want. Basically we have a pivot table hooked up to a slicer, and the slicer and the output of the pivot are provided on the report tab. We host this tab as an informal dashboard on our department's SharePoint site.<br>
