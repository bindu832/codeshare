Visualization Gallery
=======

This area is meant to be a place of inspiration. Take a look around and see what sort of ways you can visualize data. Wherever possible, there will be code or instructions on how to make these things yourself. 

Have you made some pretty cool graphs and charts, and want to share them with your CIRPA colleagues? Send them to us ([Stephen Childs](mailto:sechilds@yorku.ca), York University; [Fraser Hay](mailto:fhay@conestogac.on.ca), Conestoga College), with your code and instructions for how you made them, and we'll try to feature them here.

    <td>CONTRIBUTOR: <a href=mailto:fhay@conestogac.on.ca>Fraser Hay</a><br>PLATFORM: Stata<br>DESCRIPTION: Multi-coloured scatter plot, comparing the incoming highschool vs. program GPAs by various different intake streams. I may have adjusted the colours manually in the graph editor. Also obviously lacking useful labels. But this is more of a test.<br>CODE:<i><font face="Courier New">twoway (scatter pnavg hsavg) (scatter pnavg hsavg if prestudyprog == 1214) (scatter pnavg hsavg if prestudyprog == 1306) (scatter pnavg hsavg if newcurric == 1, mcolor(lavender))</i></font></p></td>
